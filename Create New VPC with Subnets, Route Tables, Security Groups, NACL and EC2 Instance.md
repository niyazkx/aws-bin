## 游늿 Route Tables
By default, AWS will create a Route Table at the time of creating a VPC.

- 游리 Then create another one for private route table.
  - `Name Tag`: **Private RT**

  Now, there will be two Route tables:
  - Public RT
  - Private RT
  
  Attach the Internet Gateway to **Private RT**
  - Select the **Public RT**
  - Select **Routes** Tab
  - Click **Edit routes** then click **Add route**
    - `Destination`: 0.0.0.0/0 (This means you can access this from any IP)
    - `Targets`: Select your created Internet Gateway from the dropdown.
